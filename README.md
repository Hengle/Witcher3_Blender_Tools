## Requirements
- Blender ~3.4.1

- [ArdCarraigh Blender_APX_Addon](https://github.com/ArdCarraigh/Blender_APX_Addon) - The APX addon is needed to load any redcloth items. You will have to export or download all apx from the game and add the Redcloth repo in addon settings. [Download all vanilla apx here.](https://mega.nz/file/CchGVCSb#ahDgIhxvicClEA9VHecPu6S95iT8ih2Q5kRMUHoY5ec)

    ### **Animation**:
    The current best way to work with the exported animation json is to use this specific version of Wolvenkit 0.6.1 compiled by nikich340 until Wolvenkit-7 is updated. Also the utility tool for modifying the exported files.
- [0.6.1-YML-W2ANIMS-APRIL04](https://github.com/nikich340/WolvenKit/releases/tag/0.6.1-YML-W2ANIMS-APRIL04)
- [W3-Maya-AnimUtil](https://github.com/nikich340/W3-Maya-AnimUtil) 

## Recommened 

- [FBX Import plugin for blender](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6118) - For working with any fbx files.

- [BlenderNormalGroups](https://github.com/theoldben/BlenderNormalGroups) Can switch normal map nodes to a faster custom node for better animation playback.

- [Prolog World Terrain Setup](https://mega.nz/file/WNZzCQQR#KICtWteq_OxwU_YKj4LU09kdJlBMqzzwIJd8DVGil4Q) - Not really required but has an example of how I set up basic terrain for the prolog world. It won't match how it looks in game but good enough to place game objects in blender. video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlRfUGMCyvQ

## Installation
Put "io_import_w2l" folder into your blender addons folder
Launch Blender, active the addon in Blender Preferences

in the addon settings add your own paths to:
- uncook_path = main repo where you exported all the game bundles with wcclite.exe .w2mesh files, .w2mi files, .w2ent etc.
- tex_uncook_path = repo folder with ALL exported .tga from the game
- apx_uncook_path = repo folder with ALL exported .apx from the game
- fbx_uncook_path = repo folder with ALL exported .fbx from the game

All these folders can be the same repo.

Since wcclite.exe has trouble exporting many fbx from the Witcher 3 game I have uploaded my collection of .fbx files along with Redcloth items in .apx format. Find them in this folder: [Folder Link](https://mega.nz/folder/GIR3AZBY#I4EEwkl4tjgnIv07f10n0A)
